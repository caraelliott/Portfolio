      My love of technology (and games!) has been a lifelong passion, thanks to cartoons, comic books and films.</br>
      As soon as I discovered "DOOM" existed, intensified further when I realised my family's Windows 95 could run this amazing game, I realised that technology didn't have to be fantastical to be exciting (sorry, Star Wars).</br>
      I spent most of my childhood glued to Cathode Ray screens - whether experiencing Sci Fi and Horror VHS's I was far too young to watch, or playing video-games I was far too young to play.</br>
      For the first 19 years of my life, I wouldn't be caught dead leaving the house without a Gameboy in tow, starting from the day I discovered my Dad's Original Gameboy gathering dust in the garage with Road Rash and Terminator 2 (pure sacrilege!).</br>  
      My biggest loves are Pop Culture (including film, art, history etc), Philosophy, Technology and Music.</br>
      I am a collector of pretty much everything that interests me, from comic-books, records, old cameras and camcorders to retro-videogames.</br>
      I have always had a keen interest in technology in my own time, but only started pursuing it academically/professionally after finishing my degree in Philosophy in 2016.</br>
      I wanted to get into Web Development to reskill myself and change my career path as well as out of curiosity.</br>
      In the past, I never considered I could work within an industry or company that I am personally invested in and spent years messing around with different technologies, operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOs, Unix etc) and programs without capitalising on this personal interest (mostly through playing Abandonware PC games and mods).</br>
      I am interested in Web/ Software Development, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Android and Cybersecurity.</br>
      My dream job would be to work in the games industry, possibly even developing games and I would also like to make a film one day.</br>
